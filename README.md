# Node.js TypeScript Template with Decorators, EJS, Webpack, and React

This template provides a solid foundation for building Node.js applications with TypeScript, decorators for enhanced functionality, EJS for server-side templating, Webpack for bundling assets, and React for client-side views.

Key Features:

- Node.js and TypeScript: Utilize the power of TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience when building server-side logic, with added support for decorators to enhance functionality.
- Decorators: Leverage decorators to add metadata to classes, methods, and properties, enabling advanced features such as dependency injection, route handling, and more.
- EJS Templating: Easily create dynamic HTML views on the server side using the popular EJS templating engine.
- Webpack Integration: Bundle client-side assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, with Webpack to optimize performance and facilitate development workflows.
- React Integration: Incorporate React for building interactive user interfaces on the client side, leveraging the component-based architecture and virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
